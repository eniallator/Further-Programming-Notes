## What We'll Use

### NetBeans

- Because bluej is shit

### Git

- OMG WE ARE ACTUALLY USING GIT... **FINALLY!!!**

### IDE

- How to organise your folders
- Tutorial on how to use Netbeans - good UX so no need to 😉

### Test Driven Development

- Write tests first
- Then code whatever
- Did this already in A Level compsci
- Legit just plan all the things and document all the things

#### The TDD cycle

- Write a test
- Watch the result
  - If it fails, contemplate your life choices
  - Make a change
  - Until it succeeds, go back 3 points

#### TDD Automation

- Reasons to test manually:
  - If it's difficult to automate
  - Debugging reasons
  - Learn how the class behaves by fking around with it
- For everything else:
  - Repeatable, quick and automated tests are great

### Flexible Development

- Some things are rly easy and he wants us to do TDD for them 😭😭😭😭😭😭
- They are "useful" and "help refine your code" 🙃

### Test Terminology

- Unit testing
- Integration test, system test, acceptance test
- Pre/Post test fixtures (@Before, @After)
- Assertion
- Anticipated exception

### Structure Of A Test

- Arrange
- Act
- Assert

## Summary

- What we already know
- Using netbeans this term
- Test driven development:
  1. Test first
  2. Make the test pass with as little work as you can
  3. Refactor code or improve tests
  4. Go to next thing
